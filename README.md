# Lots-of-Images
A test app that uses the Flickr API to download images within a gallery, given the ID of the gallery.

Multiple galleries can be downloaded by providing the appropriate Gallery ID. Galleries already downloaded can't be downloaded and a toast is presented to state this.

Multiple errors are searched in downloading the gallery from Flicker. The gallery title along with photos within the gallery are stored temporarily.
